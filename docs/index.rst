   contain the root `toctree` directive.

.. **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**
   ============================
   *An open source repository for the sharing of neuroimaging and genetics data, analytical
   codes, and visualization tools that are 100% ENIGMA-friendly and -focused.*

Data archiving and accessing üóù
------------------------------------
The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has a *No data, No problem* policy! We provide a central repository for archiving meta-analytical :ref:`case-control 
comparisons<load_sumstats>` across a wide range of disorders. As many ENIGMA groups have moved beyond meta-analysis 
towards ‚Äòmega‚Äô-analysis of subject-level data, the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** also includes subject-level :ref:`example data<load_ct>` 
from an individual site that have been processed according to ENIGMA protocols.

Visualization tools üé®
-------------------------------------
Tired of displaying your surface findings in tables? Look no further! The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** has got you 
covered! Check out our :ref:`visualization tools<surf_visualization>` and project your cortical and subcortical data to the surface!

   <br>

Data sharing and exploiting üíå
------------------------------------
As part of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX**, we are 
also making several data matrices openly available! As of now, these include :ref:`functional and structural 
connectivity data<hcp_connectivity>` and :ref:`transcriptomic data<gene_maps>`.

Advanced analytical workflows ü¶æ
--------------------------------------------------------
The main goal of the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** is
to provide the ENIGMA community with open-access pipelines and analytical tools for 
conducting advanced secondary analyses, offering a platform to facilitate results reproducibility both 
*within* and *across* ENIGMA Working Groups. From these workflows, users can gain further neurobiological 
insights into how disease-related regional susceptibility patterns are anchored to multiple scales of 
cortical and subcortical brain network architecture.

Step-by-step tutorials üë£
------------------------------------
The **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** includes ready-to-use and easy-to-follow code snippets
for every functionality and analytical workflow! Owing to its comprehensive tutorials, detailed functionality descriptions, 
and visual reports, the **ENIGMA TOOLBOX** is easy to use for researchers and clinicians without extensive programming expertise.
